# CNN Cats vs Dogs Project

This project demonstrates a hands-on approach to building and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the Microsoft Cats vs Dogs dataset. The focus is on understanding the inner workings of CNNs through practical implementation, training, and analysis.

## Objectives

- **Dataset Preparation:**  
  Download and preprocess a subset of the Microsoft Cats vs Dogs dataset. In this example, you will work with a dataset containing 6,000 images of cats and 6,000 images of dogs, organized in separate folders.  
  **Dataset Link:** Download the dataset from Kaggle at [Microsoft Cats vs Dogs on Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shaunthesheep/microsoft-catsvsdogs-dataset).

- **CNN Model Development:**  
  Create a CNN using convolutional, activation, pooling, and fully connected layers to perform image classification.

- **Training and Evaluation:**  
  Train the model and assess its performance using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy
  - Precision & Recall
  - AUC-ROC

- **Visualization and Analysis:**  
  Visualize sample images along with training and testing error/accuracy curves. Evaluate various performance metrics to gain insights into the model's behavior.
