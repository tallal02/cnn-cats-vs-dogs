#CNN Cats vs Dogs Project

This project demonstrates a hands-on approach to building and evaluating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the Cats vs Dogs dataset. The dataset includes a folder with 6,000 images of cats and another with 6,000 images of dogs.

## Objectives

- **Dataset Preparation:**  
  Utilize the provided dataset, which contains 6,000 images each for cats and dogs, and preprocess the images for model training.

- **CNN Model Development:**  
  Create a CNN model using layers for convolution, activation, pooling, and fully connected operations to classify images as either cat or dog.

- **Training and Evaluation:**  
  Train the model and assess its performance using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy
  - Precision & Recall
  - AUC-ROC

- **Visualization and Analysis:**  
  Visualize sample images, training and testing error/accuracy curves, and analyze performance metrics to better understand the CNN's behavior.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cnn-cats-vs-dogs-project.git
   cd cnn-cats-vs-dogs-project
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   Ensure the `cats/` and `dogs/` folders are populated with the images. If additional preprocessing is required, refer to the instructions in the `data/` folder.

2. **Train the Model:**  
   Run the training script to start the model training process:

   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate the Model:**  
   After training, execute the evaluation script to view performance metrics:

   ```bash
   python src/evaluate.py
   ```

4. **Explore Visualizations:**  
   Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore visualizations of the training process and model performance analysis.

## Results

This project provides:
- A well-defined CNN model for classifying cats and dogs.
- Training and testing error/accuracy plots.
- Detailed evaluation metrics including a confusion matrix, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
